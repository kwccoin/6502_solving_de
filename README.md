## Solving a differential equation with a 6502
An example how to solve a differential equations on a 6502 with Woz's floating point code.

## How and Why?
I'm really into computer history and math. I liked how the whole home computer thing started and the time where people actually coded in assembly. I'm not into games, so if I had one I would try to do lots of math stuff. There are always differential equations in physics which have to be solved with numerical methods. But I will solve a really easy one to show you how to do it.
